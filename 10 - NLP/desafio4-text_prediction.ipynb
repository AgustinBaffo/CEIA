years\\nAnd I\\'ve not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I\\'ve grown\\nBut I can\\'t wait to go home\\n\\nI\\'m on my way\\nDriving at 90 down those country lanes\\nSinging to \"Tiny Dancer\"\\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, and it\\'s real\\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes\\nRunning from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends\\nHad my first kiss on a Friday night, I don\\'t reckon that I did it right\\nBut I was younger then, take me back to when\\n\\nWe found weekend jobs, when we got paid\\nWe\\'d buy cheap spirits and drink them straight\\nMe and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we\\'ve grown\\nBut I can\\'t wait to go home\\n\\nI\\'m on my way\\nDriving at 90 down those country lanes\\nSinging to \"Tiny Dancer\"\\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, and it\\'s real\\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\\nOver the castle on the hill\\nOver the castle on the hill\\n\\nOne friend left to sell clothes\\nOne works down by the coast\\nOne had two kids but lives alone\\nOne\\'s brother overdosed\\nOne\\'s already on his second wife\\nOne\\'s just barely getting by\\nBut these people raised me\\nAnd I can\\'t wait to go home\\n\\nAnd I\\'m on my way, I still remember\\nThese old country lanes\\nWhen we did not know the answers\\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, it\\'s real\\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\\nOver the castle on the hill\\nOver the castle on the hill\\nYou are the one, girl\\nYou know that it\\'s true\\nI\\'m feeling younger\\nEvery time that I\\'m alone with you\\n\\nWe were sitting in a parked car\\nStealing kisses in a front yard\\nWe got questions we shouldn\\'t had asked but\\n\\nHow would you feel\\nIf I told you I loved you\\nIt\\'s just something that I want to do\\nI\\'m taking my time, spending my life\\nFalling deeper in love with you\\nSo tell me that you love me too\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the summer, as the lilacs blew\\nBlood flows deeper than a river\\nEvery moment that I spend with you\\n\\nWe were sat upon our best friend\\'s roof\\nI had both of my arms around you\\nWatching the sunrise replace the moon\\n\\nHow would you feel\\nIf I told you I loved you\\nIt\\'s just something that I want to do\\nI\\'m taking my time, spending my life\\nFalling deeper in love with you\\nSo tell me that you love me too\\n\\nWe were sitting in a parked car\\nStealing kisses in a front yard\\nWe got questions we shouldn\\'t had asked\\n\\nHow would you feel\\nIf I told you I loved you\\nIt\\'s just something that I want to do\\nI\\'m taking my time, spending my life\\nFalling deeper in love with you\\nSo tell me that you love me too\\nTell me that you love me too\\nTell me that you love me too\\nWhen your legs don\\'t work like they used to before\\nAnd I can\\'t sweep you off of your feet\\nWill your mouth still remember the taste of my love?\\nWill your eyes still smile from your cheeks?\\n\\nAnd darling I will be loving you \\'til we\\'re 70\\nAnd baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23\\nAnd I\\'m thinking \\'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways\\nMaybe just the touch of a hand\\nWell, me I fall in love with you every single day\\nAnd I just wanna tell you I am\\nSo honey now\\nTake me into your loving arms\\nKiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\nPlace your head on my beating heart\\nI\\'m thinking out loud\\nThat maybe we found love right where we are\\n\\nWhen my hair\\'s all but gone and my memory fades\\nAnd the crowds don\\'t remember my name\\nWhen my hands don\\'t play the strings the same way\\nI know you will still love me the same\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it\\'s evergreen\\nAnd baby your smile\\'s forever in my mind and memory\\nI\\'m thinking \\'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways\\nMaybe it\\'s all part of a plan\\nWell, I\\'ll just keep on making the same mistakes\\nHoping that you\\'ll understand\\nBut baby now\\n\\nTake me into your loving arms\\nKiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\nPlace your head on my beating heart\\nThinking out loud\\nThat maybe we found love right where we are\\n\\nSo baby now\\nTake me into your loving arms\\nKiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\nOh darling, place your head on my beating heart\\nI\\'m thinking out loud\\nThat maybe we found love right where we are\\nOh baby we found love right where we are\\n\\nAnd we found love right where we are\\nIt\\'s just another night, and I\\'m staring at the moon\\nI saw a shooting star and thought of you\\nI sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew\\nIf you were here, I\\'d sing to you\\nYou\\'re on the other side, as this skyline splits in two\\nMiles away from seeing you\\nBut I can see the stars from America\\nI wonder do you see them too?\\n\\nSo open your eyes and see, the way our horizons meet\\nAnd all of the lights will lead, into the night with me\\nAnd I know these scars will bleed\\nBut both of our hearts believe\\nAll of these stars will guide us home\\n\\nI can hear your heart on the radio beat\\nThey\\'re playing \"Chasing Cars\" and I thought of us\\nBack to the time you were laying next to me\\nI looked across and fell in love\\nSo I took your hand back through London\\'s streets and knew\\nEverything led back to you\\nSo can you see the stars over Amsterdam?\\nHear the song our heart is beating to?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet\\nAnd all of the lights will lead into the night with me\\nAnd I know these scars will bleed\\nBut both of our hearts believe\\nAll of these stars will guide us home\\n\\nAnd all\\nAnd all\\nAnd all\\nI can see the stars from America\\nThings were all good yesterday\\nAnd then the devil took your memory\\nAnd if you fell to your death today\\nI hope that heaven is your resting place\\nI heard the doctors put your chest in pain\\nBut then that could have been the medicine\\nAnd now you’re lying in the bed again\\nEither way I’ll cry with the rest of them.\\n\\nAnd my father told me, “Son,\\nIt’s not his fault he doesn’t know your face,\\nAnd you’re not the only one.\\nAlthough my grandma used to say, that he used to sing\\n\\nDarling hold me in your arms the way you did last night\\nAnd we\\'ll lie inside, a little while he wrote\\nI could look into your eyes until the sun comes up\\nAnd we’re wrapped in light, in life, in love.\\nPut your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut\\nFor they’re designed to be together oh\\nWith your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one\\nAnd we’re set alight, we’re afire love, love, love oh.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThings were all good yesterday\\nThen the devil took your breath away\\nAnd now we’re left here in the pain\\nBlack suit, black tie standin\\' in the rain\\nAnd now my family is one again\\nStapled together with the strangers and a friend.\\nCame to my mind I should paint it with a pen\\nSix years old I remember when.\\n\\nAnd my father told me, “Son,\\nIt’s not his fault he doesn’t know your face,\\nAnd you’re not the only one.\\nAlthough my grandma used to say, he used to say…\\n\\nDarling hold me in your arms the way you did last night\\nAnd we\\'ll lie inside, a little while he wrote\\nI could look into your eyes until the sun comes up\\nAnd we’re wrapped in light, in life, in love.\\nPut your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut\\nFor they’re designed

sing hallelujah\\nAnd my mother and all of my family\\nRise from the seats to sing halellujah\\nAnd my brother and all of my family\\nRise from the seats to sing hallelujah\\nAnd all of my brothers and my sisters, yeah\\nAnd my father and all of my family\\nRise from the seats to sing hallelujah\\nHallelujah\\nHallelujah\\nHallelujah\\nBibia be ye ye\\nI lost my shoes last night\\nI don\\'t know where I put my keys\\nI was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree\\nI bet my mother\\'s proud of me from each scar upon my knuckle\\nAnd each grass upon my knee, and all I know is\\nI got a call

was younger then, take me back to when I\\n\\nFound my heart and broke it here\\nMade friends and lost them through the years\\nAnd I\\'ve not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I\\'ve grown\\nBut I can\\'t wait to go home\\n\\nI\\'m on my way\\nDriving at 90 down those country lanes\\nSinging to \"Tiny Dancer\"\\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, and it\\'s real\\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes\\nRunning from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends\\nHad my first kiss on a Friday night, I don\\'t reckon that I did it right\\nBut I was younger then, take me back to when\\n\\nWe found weekend jobs, when we got paid\\nWe\\'d buy cheap spirits and drink them straight\\nMe and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we\\'ve grown\\nBut I can\\'t wait to go home\\n\\nI\\'m on my way\\nDriving at 90 down those country lanes\\nSinging to \"Tiny Dancer\"\\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, and it\\'s real\\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\\nOver the castle on the hill\\nOver the castle on the hill\\n\\nOne friend left to sell clothes\\nOne works down by the coast\\nOne had two kids but lives alone\\nOne\\'s brother overdosed\\nOne\\'s already on his second wife\\nOne\\'s just barely getting by\\nBut these people raised me\\nAnd I can\\'t wait to go home\\n\\nAnd I\\'m on my way, I still remember\\nThese old country lanes\\nWhen we did not know the answers\\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, it\\'s real\\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\\nOver the castle on the hill\\nOver the castle on the hill\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\nI met this girl late last year\\nShe said don’t you worry if I disappear\\nI told her I’m not really looking for another mistake\\nI called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait\\nBut then I jump right in\\nA week later return\\nI reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn\\nBut I gave her my time for two or three nights\\nThen I put it on pause until the moment was right\\nI went away for months until our paths crossed again\\nShe told me I was never looking for a friend\\nMaybe you could swing by my room around 10\\nBaby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin\\nWe’ll be in between the sheets until the late AM\\nBaby if you wanted me then you should’ve just said\\nShe’s singing\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\nDon’t fuck with my love\\nThat heart is so cold\\nAll over my arm\\nI don’t wanna know that babe\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\nDon’t fuck with my love\\nI told her she knows\\nTake aim and reload\\nI don’t wanna know that babe\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\nFor a couple weeks I\\nOnly want to see her\\nWe drink away the days with a take away pizza\\nBefore a text message was the only way to reach her\\nNow she’s staying at my place and loves the way I treat her\\nSinging out Aretha\\nAll over the track like a feature\\nNever want to sleep I guess that I don’t want to either\\nBut me and her we make money the same way\\nFour cities, two planes the same day\\nThose shows have never been what it’s about\\nBut maybe we’ll go together and just figure it out\\nI’d rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch\\nBut we should get on a plane\\nOr we’ll be missing it now\\nWish I’d have written it down\\nThe way that things played out\\nWhen she was kissing him\\nHow? I was confused about\\nShe should figure it out while I’m sat here singing\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\nDon’t fuck with my love\\nThat heart is so cold\\nAll over my arm\\nI don’t wanna know that babe\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\nDon’t fuck with my love\\nI told her she knows\\nTake aim and reload\\nI don’t wanna know that babe\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\n*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door\\nI don’t even know if she knows what for\\nShe was crying on my shoulder\\nI already told ya\\nTrust and respect is what we do this for\\nI never intended to be next\\nBut you didn’t need to take him to bed that’s all\\nAnd I never saw him as a threat\\nUntil you disappeared with him to have sex of course\\nIt’s not like we were both on tour\\nWe were staying on the same fucking hotel floor\\nAnd I wasn’t looking for a promise or commitment\\nBut it was never just fun and I thought you were different\\nThis is not the way you realize what you wanted\\nIt’s a bit too much, too late if I’m honest\\nAll this time God knows I’m singing\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\nDon’t fuck with my love\\nThat heart is so cold\\nAll over my arm\\nI don’t wanna know that babe\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\nDon’t fuck with my love\\nI told her she knows\\nTake aim and reload\\nI don’t wanna know that babe\\nAh-la-la-la-la\\n\\n[Ed Sheeran]\\nWaking up, half past five\\nBlood on pillow and one bruised eye\\nDrunk too much, you know what I\\'m like\\nBut you should\\'ve seen the other guy\\n\\nThis ain\\'t the right time for you to fall in love with me\\nBaby I\\'m just being honest\\nAnd I know my lies could not make you believe\\nWe\\'re running in circles that\\'s why\\n\\nIn my dark times I\\'ll be going back to the street\\nPromising everything I do not mean\\nIn my dark times, baby this is all I could be\\nDon\\'t think my mother could love me for me\\nIn my dark times, in my dark times\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[The Weeknd]\\nLight one up, let me bum a smoke\\nStill calming down, dripping throat\\nI got

not make you believe\\nRunning in circles that\\'s why\\n\\nIn my dark times I\\'ll be going back to the street\\nPromising everything I do not mean\\nIn my dark times, baby this is all I could be\\nOnly my mother could love me for me\\nIn my dark times, in my dark times\\n\\nIn my dark times I\\'ve still got some problems I know\\nDriving to fast but just moving to slow\\nAnd I\\'ve got something I\\'ve been trying to let go\\nPulling me back every time\\n\\nIn my dark times taking it back to the street\\nMaking those promises that I could not keep\\nIn my dark times, baby this is all I could be\\nOnly my mother could love me for me\\nIn my dark times taking it down to the street\\nMaking those promises that I would not keep\\nIn my dark times this is all I could be\\nOnly my mother could of loved me for me\\nIn my dark times, in my dark times\\nIn my dark times\\nOh, maybe I came on too strong\\nMaybe I waited too long\\nMaybe I played my cards wrong\\nOh, just a little bit wrong\\nBaby I apologize for it\\n\\nI could fall, or I could fly\\nHere in your aeroplane\\nAnd I could live, I could die\\nHanging on the words you say\\nAnd I\\'ve been known to give my all\\nAnd jumping in harder than\\nTen thousand rocks on the lake\\n\\nSo don\\'t call me baby\\nUnless you mean it\\nDon\\'t tell me you need me\\nIf you don\\'t believe it\\nSo let me know the truth\\nBefore I dive right into you\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re a mystery\\nI have travelled the world, there\\'s no other girl like you\\nNo one, what\\'s your history?\\nDo you have a tendency to lead some people on?\\n\\'Cause I heard you do, mm\\n\\nI could fall, or I could fly\\nHere in your aeroplane\\nAnd I could live, I could die\\nHanging on the words you say\\nAnd I\\'ve been known to give my all\\nAnd lie awake everyday\\nDon\\'t know how much I can take\\nSo don\\'t call me baby\\nUnless you mean it\\nDon\\'t tell me you need me\\nIf you don\\'t believe it\\nSo let me know the

all\\nSitting back, looking at\\nEvery mess that I\\'ve made\\nSo don\\'t call me baby\\nUnless you mean it\\nDon\\'t tell me you need me\\nIf you don\\'t believe it\\nSo let me know the truth\\nBefore I dive right into you\\nBefore I dive right into you\\nBefore I dive right into you\\nI wanna be drunk when I wake up\\nOn the right side of the wrong bed\\nAnd every excuse I made up\\nTell you the truth I hate\\nWhat didn\\'t kill me\\nIt never made me stronger at all.\\nLove will scar your make-up lip sticks to me\\nSo now I\\'ll maybe leave back there\\nI\\'m sat here wishing I was sober\\nI know I\\'ll never hold you like I used to.\\n\\nBut our house gets cold when you cut the heating\\nWithout you to hold I\\'ll be freezing\\nCan\\'t rely on my heart to beat it\\n\\'Cause you take part of it every evening\\nTake words out of my mouth just from breathing\\nReplace with phrases like when you\\'re leaving me.\\n\\nShould I, should I?\\nMaybe I\\'ll get drunk again\\nI\\'ll be drunk again\\nI\\'ll be drunk again\\nTo feel a little love\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI wanna hold your heart in both hands\\nI\\'ll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can\\nAnd I\\'ve got no plans for the weekend\\nSo shall we speak then\\nKeep it between friends\\nThough I know you\\'ll never love me like you used to.\\n\\nThere maybe other people like us\\nYou see the flicker of the clip when they light up\\nFlames just create us, burns don\\'t heal like before\\nYou don\\'t hold me anymore.\\n\\nOn cold days Coldplay\\'s out like the band\\'s the name\\nI know I can\\'t heal things with a hand shake\\nYou know I can\\'t change as I began saying\\nYou cut me wide open like landscape\\nOpen bottles of beer but never champagne\\nWe\\'ll applaud you with the sound that my hands make.\\n\\nShould I, should I?\\nMaybe I\\'ll get drunk again\\nI\\'ll be drunk again\\nI\\'ll be drunk again\\nTo feel a little love.\\n\\nAll by myself\\nI\\'m here again\\nAll by myself\\nYou know I\\'ll never change\\nAll by myself\\nAll by myself\\nI\\'m just drunk again\\nI\\'ll be drunk again\\nI\\'ll be drunk again\\nTo feel a little love.\\nI was born inside a small town, I\\'ve lost that state of mind\\nLearned to sing inside the Lord\\'s house, but stopped at the age of nine\\nI forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride\\nThe paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind\\nSo blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life\\nFriends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride\\nAnd when the world\\'s against me is when I really come alive\\nAnd everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride\\nYou know that I\\'ve got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs\\nI think life has got to the point I know without it\\'s no fun\\nI need to get in the right mind and clear myself up\\nInstead, I look in the mirror questioning what I\\'ve become\\nI guess it\\'s a stereotypical day for someone like me\\nWithout a nine-to-five job or an uni degree\\nTo be caught up in the trappings of the industry\\nThey showed me the locked doors I find another use of key\\nAnd you\\'ll see\\n\\nI\\'m well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me\\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\\nAnother one to take the sting away\\nI am happy on my own, so here I\\'ll stay\\nSave your lovin\\' arms for a rainy day\\nAnd I\\'ll find comfort in my pain\\nEraser\\n\\nI used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs\\nI chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong\\nI think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell\\nRelationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well\\nAnd ain\\'t nobody wanna see you down in the dumps\\nBecause you\\'re living your dream, man, this shit should be fun\\nPlease know that I\\'m not trying to preach like I\\'m Reverend Run\\nI beg you, don\\'t be disappointed with the man I\\'ve become\\nOur conversations with my father on the A14\\nAge twelve telling me I\\'ve gotta chase those dreams\\nNow I\\'m playing for the people, dad, and they know me\\nWith my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans\\nWembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou\\nI may have grown up but I hope that Damien\\'s proud\\nAnd to the next generation, inspiration\\'s allowed\\nThe world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now\\nSomehow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me\\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\\nAnother one to take the sting away\\nI am not beyond my own, so here I\\'ll stay\\nSave your lovin arms for a rainy day\\nAnd I\\'ll find comfort in my pain\\nEraser\\nAnd I\\'ll find comfort in my pain\\nEraser\\nAnd I\\'ll find comfort in my pain\\nEraser\\n\\nI woke up this morning lookin\\' in the mirror\\nThinkin\\' to myself that I should probably be thinner\\nThe industry told me to look like them\\nBut I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner\\nI wish that she could have been my first time\\nAnd I wish that I\\'d never took that first line\\nAnd I wish that every word in this verse rhymed\\nBut forgive me if it doesn\\'t\\nI wish that I could make peace with my older cousin\\nI wish he didn\\'t think that it was me when it wasn\\'t\\nI wish I didn\\'t love it when I\\'m high and my face feels buzzin\\'\\nAnd the taste stays underneath my tongue\\nWish that I had known what to do as a youngling\\nWish I hadn\\'t dropped out of school and missed every single party\\nWith that hardly matters now, man, does it?\\nWish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it\\nI wish creatin\\' art didn\\'t come with a budget\\nBut while we\\'re on the subject\\nI wish my private life would have never gone public\\nBut that\\'s the sacrifice that we make\\nSpendin\\' my whole time high livin\\' life away\\n\\nSingin\\' this is how we\\'re livin\\' down here\\nSittin\\' on the edge, lookin\\' out without fear\\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don\\'t care\\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\\nI\\'m singin\\' this is how we\\'re livin\\' down here\\nSittin\\' on the edge, lookin\\' out without fear\\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don\\'t care\\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\\n\\nI wish my family and friends they stay healthy\\nI wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy\\nI found myself late night wishin\\' on a star\\nEveryday I wish I\\'d never broken a heart, uh\\nAnd I wish I\\'d never run to\\nEvery woman that I loved that kept my life and what it\\'s come to\\nI wish I was the role model you looked up to\\nIf I told my fans the things I did they\\'d say, \"Fuck you\"\\nI wish I was home more\\nI wish my teens could see the kids on the birthdays, but yo, we\\'re on tour\\nAnd I wish I\\'d grow more, wish I told more\\nPeople that I love \\'em but it\\'s in the music that I\\'m known for\\nAnd I wish he never got cancer\\nAnd if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?\\nOh yes, I guess it does, and we\\'re still stressin\\' \\'cause\\nEvery day this shit gets the best of us\\nUsin\\' my balance on eraser blades\\nSpendin\\' my whole time high wishing life would wait\\n\\nSingin\\' this is how we\\'re livin\\' down here\\nSittin\\' on the edge, lookin\\' out without fear\\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don\\'t care\\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\\nI\\'m singin\\' this is how we\\'re livin\\' down here\\nSittin\\' on the edge, lookin\\' out without fear\\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don\\'t care\\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\\n\\nI\\'m using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat cold\\nMum sayin\\', \"Don\\'t smoke,\" no, I don\\'t listen, I got\\nLove for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast\\nPeople that I don\\'t know share the same vision\\nI find truth in the hard times and words that aren\\'t mine\\nTryin\\' to find a love with a compatible star sign\\nSometimes I can\\'t write, sentences can\\'t rhyme\\nStarin\\' at my notepad quick, I\\'m tryin\\' to find mine\\nShit, quick before I hit it again\\nSurrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men\\nAnd who knew that I\\'d be paid just to pick up a pen\\nJust let me hit the studio when we can rip it again\\nI\\'m a competitive dick, with an adrenaline kick\\nMy daddy told me work hard and you can never be shit\\nI\\'ve seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad\\nSet back here reminiscing \\'bout the times we had\\nOne wish\\nIt’s alright to cry\\nEven my dad does sometimes\\nSo don’t wipe your eyes\\nTears remind you you’re alive\\nIt’s alright to die\\nCause death\\'s the only thing you haven’t tried\\nBut just for tonight hold on\\n\\nSo live life like you’re giving up\\nCause you act like you are\\nGo ahead and just live it up\\nGo on and tear me apart\\n\\nIt’s alright to shake\\nEven my hand does sometimes\\nSo inside the rage Against the dying of the light\\nIt’s alright to say that death’s the only thing you haven’t tried\\nBut just for today hold on\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo live life like you’re giving up\\nCause you act like you are\\nGo ahead and just live it up\\nGo on and tear me apart\\n\\nSo live life like your giving up\\nCause you act like you are\\nGo ahead and just live it up\\nGo on and tear me apart hold on\\n\\nSo live life like your giving up\\nCause you act like you are\\nGo ahead and just live it up\\nGo on and tear me apart hold on\\nI didn\\'t mean to break your heart\\nI was just lonely\\nAnd everybody falls apart sometimes\\nI know you\\'ve found another one\\nBut won\\'t you just hold me tonight\\nI wish I never called you up\\nNobody told me\\nAnd they don\\'t know, they don\\'t speak anymore\\nSo take a good look at us\\nWon\\'t you just hold me tonight\\nAnd I would stop trying to fall in love again\\nAnd keep it a secret\\nIt never works out anyway\\nBut I am not, anything like a voice\\nCause you were the only one for me\\nYeah, yeah\\n\\nCause maybe I don\\'t want to lose a lover and friend in one night\\nIf that\\'s right\\nI shouldn\\'t have f*cked with your mind\\nAnd your life too many times\\nOr maybe I don\\'t want to be lonely\\nDarling you are my only love\\nBehind my true loves, everything you are\\n\\nI never meant to sleep around\\nI was just lonely\\nYou did the same, again, and again\\nI know\\nSo here\\'s to the both of us\\nHere\\'s to our story tonight\\nOh I would stop trying to fall in love again\\nAnd keep it a secret\\nIt never works out anyway\\nBut I am not, anything like a voice\\nCause you were the only one for me\\nYeah\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCause maybe I don\\'t want to lose a lover and friend in one night\\nIf that\\'s right\\nI shouldn\\'t have f*cked with your mind\\nAnd your life too many times\\nOr maybe I don\\'t want to be lonely\\nDarling you are my only love\\nBehind my true loves, everything you are\\n\\nWhen I see my future\\nIt is with you\\nWe\\'ll get there\\nI want my children to be with you together\\n\\nCause maybe I don\\'t want to lose a lover and friend in one night\\nIf that\\'s right\\nI shouldn\\'t have f*cked with your mind\\nAnd your life too many times\\nOr maybe I don\\'t want to be lonely\\nDarling you are my only love\\nBehind my true loves, everything you are\\nBehind my true loves, everything you are\\nBehind my true loves, everything you are\\nWe\\'re not, no we\\'re not friends, nor have we ever been\\nWe

crashed into this lonely town\\nAnd with that shadow upon the ground\\nI hear my people screaming out\\n\\nNow I see fire, inside the mountain\\nI see fire, burning the trees\\nI see fire, hollowing souls\\nI see fire, blood in the breeze\\n\\nI see fire, oh you know I saw a city burning (fire)\\nI see fire, feel the heat upon my skin (fire)\\nAnd I see fire (fire)\\nAnd I see fire burn auburn on

own\\nTwenty two grand kids now growing old in that house that your brother bought ya\\nOh the summer day when I proposed, I made that wedding ring from [?] gold\\nAnd I asked her father, but her daddy said, \"No, you won\\'t marry my daughter\"\\n\\nShe and I went on the run\\nDon\\'t care about religion\\nI\\'m gonna marry the woman I love\\nDown by the wexford border\\nShe was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran\\nShe took my name and then we were one\\nDown by the wexford border\\n\\nWill I met her at [Guy\\'s?] in the second world war\\nShe was working on a soldier\\'s ward\\nNever had I seen such beauty before\\nThe second that I saw her\\nNancy was my yellow rose\\nAnd we got married wearing borrowed clothes\\nWe got eight children now growing old\\nFive sons and three daughters\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShe and I went on the run\\nDon\\'t care about religion\\nI\\'m gonna marry the woman I love\\nDown by the wexford border\\nShe was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran\\nShe took my name and then we were one\\nDown by the wexford border\\n\\nFrom her snow white in her [?] and jet black hair\\nOver sixty years I\\'ve been loving her\\nNow we\\'re sat by the fire in our old armchairs\\nYou know Nancy I adore ya\\nFrom a farm boy born near Belfast town\\nI never worried about the king and crown\\n\\'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground\\nThat\\'s the difference, I \\xa0assure ya\\n\\nShe and I went on the run\\nDon\\'t care about religion\\nI\\'m gonna marry the woman I love\\nDown by the wexford border\\nShe was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran\\nShe took my name and then we were one\\nDown by the wexford border\\nI met you when I was a teen\\nBut then you were one as well\\nAnd I could play the guitar\\nJust like ringing a bell\\nSometimes I wonder\\nAnd any other summer could you have been my part time lover\\nTo me listening to Stevie Wonder\\nUnder the covers where we used to lay\\nAnd Re: Stacks is what the speakers play\\nI’ll be on tour almost every day\\nWhen I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay\\nJust watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed\\nGetting high as two kites, we needed no breathe\\nWe used each others edge just for the people to see\\nAnd stay up all night like when we needed to sleep\\nWe go anywhere, our minds would take us\\nAnd also you are beautiful without your make-up\\nAnd you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause\\nWe can all be loved the way God made us\\nAnd time’s the only reason that we could break up\\nCause you would always tell me I\\'m away too much\\nDistance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane\\nOr make a mistake, say it again\\n\\nOh Nina\\nYou should go Nina\\n‘Cause I ain’t ever coming home\\nNina, oh, won’t you leave me now\\nAnd I’ve been living on the road Nina\\nBut then again you should know Nina\\nCause that’s you and me both\\nNina, oh, won’t you leave me now\\nNow\\n\\nAnd every weekend in the winter\\nYou’d be wearing my hoodie\\nWith draw strings pulled tight\\nTo keep your face from the cold\\nTaking day trips to the local\\nWhere we be on the road\\nCause every day when I was away\\nWe\\'d only speak on the phone\\nWatching Blue Planet\\nCreating new habits\\nActing as if we were two rabbits\\nAnd then you\\'d vanish\\nBack to the borrow with all the Celtics\\nI disappear\\nYou call me selfish, I understand\\nBut I can’t help it\\nI put my job over everything\\nExcept my family and friends\\nBut you’ll be in between forever\\nSo I guess we’ll have to take a step back\\nOverlook the situation\\nCause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications\\nAnd I’m not saying we should be taking a break\\nJust re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late\\nSo we kinda need to deal with the pain\\nOr wait to get on the plane\\nBut in the day we’ll have to say it again\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOh Nina\\nYou should go Nina\\n‘Cause I ain’t ever coming home\\nNina, oh, won’t you leave me now\\nAnd I’ve been living on the road Nina\\nBut then again you should know Nina\\nCause that’s you and me both\\nNina, oh, won’t you leave me now\\nNow\\n\\nLove will come and love will go\\nBut you can make it on your own\\nSing that song, go, oh won’t you leave me now\\nPeople grow, and fall apart\\nBut you can mend your broken heart\\nTake it back, oh oh won’t you leave me now\\n\\nOh Nina\\nYou should go Nina\\n‘Cause I ain’t ever coming home\\nNina, oh, won’t you leave me now\\nAnd I’ve been living on the road Nina\\nBut then again you should know Nina\\nCause that’s you and me both\\nNina, oh, won’t you leave me now\\nNow\\nNo, no, no, no, no\\n\\nI heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans\\nGoes to the

told me\\nAnd he reacts the same way as that OG\\nBut it\\'s old school, it\\'s like \\'03\\nAnd this old man is my old me\\nTakes a long time to happen so fast\\nTo realize that your future is

to meet ya\\nAnd then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila\\nI already know she’s a keeper\\nJust from this one small act of kindness, I’m in deep\\nIf anybody finds out I’m meant to drive home\\nBut I drunk all of it now, no\\nSobering up\\nWe just sit on the couch one thing led to another\\nNow she’s kissing my mouth\\n\\nI need you darling, Come on set the tone\\nIf you feel

from your head to toe\\nSay you love me to my face\\nI need it more than your embrace\\nJust say you want me, that\\'s all it takes\\nHeart\\'s getting torn from your mistakes\\n\\n\\'Cause I don\\'t wanna fall in love\\nIf you don\\'t wanna try,\\nBut all that I\\'ve been thinking of\\nIs maybe that you might\\nBaby it looks as though we\\'re running out of words to say\\nAnd love\\'s floating\\n\\nJust say you love me, just for today\\nAnd don\\'t give me time \\'cause that\\'s not the same\\nWant to feel burning flames when you say my name\\nWant to feel passion flow into my bones\\nLike blood through my veins\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Cause I don\\'t wanna fall in love\\nIf you don\\'t wanna try,\\nBut all that I\\'ve been thinking of\\nIs maybe that you might\\nBaby it looks as though we\\'re running out of words to say\\nAnd love\\'s floating away\\n\\nWon\\'t you stay?\\nWon\\'t you stay?\\nSlowly slowly you run for me,\\nBut do you know me at all?\\nSome one told me love controls everything\\nBut only if you know\\n\\n\\'Cause I don\\'t wanna fall in love\\n(No no no no)\\nIf you don\\'t wanna try\\n(Try sometime)\\xa0\\nBut all that I\\'ve been thinking of\\nIs maybe that you might\\n(You might)\\n\\'Cause I don\\'t wanna fall in love\\nIf you don\\'t wanna try\\nBut all that I\\'ve been thinking of\\nIs maybe that you might\\nBaby it looks as though we\\'re running out of words to say\\nAnd love\\'s floating away\\nWon\\'t you stay?\\nWon\\'t you stay?\\nI gave all my oxygen to people that could breath\\nI gave many my money and now we don\\'t even speak\\nI drive miles and miles but would you do the same for me\\nOh, honestly?\\nOffered up my shoulder just for you to cry upon\\xa0\\nGave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm\\nThey gave me the heartache and in return I gave a wing\\nIts goes on and on and on\\n\\nLife can get you down so I just numb the way it feels\\nI drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills\\nAnd all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf, my farewell\\nSo before I save someone else, I\\'ve got to save myself\\n\\nI gave you all my energy and I took away your pain\\n\\'Cause human beings are destined to [?] or drink\\nWhat time do we stand upon come have it looks the same?\\nAnd only scars remain\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLife can get you down so I just numb the way it feels\\nI drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills\\nAnd all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf my farewell\\nSo before I save someone else, I\\'ve got to save myself\\n\\nBut if don\\'t then I\\'ll go back to where I\\'m becoming a stranger\\nJust because they ended being just like that\\nOh, I\\'m here again between the devil and the danger\\nBut I guess it\\'s hust of nature\\nMy dad was wrong \\'cause I\\'m not like my mum\\n\\'Cause she\\'d just smile and I\\'m complaining in a song, but it helps\\nSo before I save someone else, I\\'ve got to save myself\\n\\nLife can get you down so I just numb the way it feels\\nI drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills\\nAnd all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf, my farewell\\nSo before I save someone else, I\\'ve got to save myself\\nAnd before I blame someone else, I\\'ve got to save myself\\nAnd before I love someone else, I\\'ve got to love myself\\nI took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill\\nI threw the day old tea from the cup\\nPacked\\xa0up the photo album Matthew had made\\nMemories of a life that\\'s been loved\\nTook the get well soon cards and stuffed animals\\nPoured the old ginger been down the sink\\nDad always told me, \"Don\\'t you cry when you\\'re down\"\\nBut mum, there\\'s a tear every time that I blink\\n\\nOh I\\'m in pieces, it\\'s tearing me up, but I know\\nA heart that\\'s broke is a heart that\\'s been loved\\n\\nSo I\\'ll sing Hallelujah\\nYou were an angel in the shape of my mum\\nWhen I fell down you\\'d be there holding me up\\nSpread your wings as you go\\nAnd when God takes you back we\\'ll say Hallelujah\\nYou\\'re home\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up\\nFolded your nightgowns neatly in a case\\nJohn says he\\'d drive then put his hand on my cheek\\nAnd wiped a tear from the side of my face\\n\\nI hope that I see the world as you did cause I know\\nA life with love is a life that\\'s been lived\\n\\nSo I\\'ll sing Hallelujah\\nYou were an angel in the shape of my mum\\nWhen I fell down you\\'d be there holding me up\\nSpread your wings as you go\\nAnd when God takes you back we\\'ll say Hallelujah\\nYou\\'re home\\nHallelujah\\nYou were an angel in the shape of my mum\\nYou got to see the person I have become\\nSpread your wings and I\\'ll know that\\nWhen God took you back he said Hallelujah\\nYou\\'re home...\\nThe club isn\\'t the best place to find a lover\\nSo the bar is where I go\\nMe and my friends at the table doing shots\\nDrinking faster and then we talk slow\\nCome over and start up a conversation with just me\\nAnd trust me I\\'ll give it a chance now\\nTake my hand, stop\\nPut Van The Man on the jukebox\\nAnd then we start to dance\\nAnd now I\\'m singing like\\n\\nGirl, you know I want your love\\nYour love was handmade for somebody like me\\nCome on now, follow my lead\\nI may be crazy, don\\'t mind me\\nSay, boy, let\\'s not talk too much\\nGrab on my waist and put that body on me\\nCome on now, follow my lead\\nCome, come on now, follow my lead\\n\\nI\\'m in love with the shape of you\\nWe push and pull like a magnet do\\nAlthough my heart is falling too\\nI\\'m in love with your body\\nAnd last night you were in my room\\nAnd now my bedsheets smell like you\\nEvery day

and me are thrifty\\nSo go all you can eat\\nFill up your bag and I fill up a plate\\nWe talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour\\nAnd how your family is doing okay\\nLeave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat\\nTell the driver make the radio play\\nAnd I\\'m singing like\\n\\nGirl, you know I want your love\\nYour love was handmade for somebody like me\\nCome on now, follow my lead\\nI may be crazy, don\\'t mind me\\nSay, boy, let\\'s not talk too much\\nGrab on my waist and put that body on me\\nCome on now, follow my lead\\nCome, come on now, follow my lead\\n\\nI\\'m

discovering something brand new\\nI\\'m in love with the shape of you\\nI woke up early looking out my window\\nAt the Amsterdam sky\\nOh baby I was high last night\\nCafe clouds and red lights\\nWhen I gotcha in mind\\nYou slowed down time\\nOh baby I was out of my mind\\nSing a song cover and hold me tight\\n\\nI drill you deep into my chest\\nThat’s where it feels the best\\nYou can remove all the scars\\nStop them from breaking my heart\\nBeen on a hurting spree\\nThat brought out the worst in me\\n‘cause I don’t want to be alone\\n\\n‘cause everyday that I’m breathing I think you are the one\\nI love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue\\nFeel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs\\nSweet Mary Jane won’t you sing another song\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCafé clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky\\nOh baby what a beautiful sight\\nBut we’re only satellites\\nOh di ba di ba oh la lights\\nOh baby I am so damn high\\nHave you seen my eyes\\n\\nWith the beat beat of my heart\\nYou take me back to the start\\nWhere everything began\\nHolding you inside my hands\\nBetween my fingers and thumb\\nI seal you in with my tongue,\\n‘Cause I don’t want to be alone\\n\\n‘Cause everyday that I’m breathing I think you are the one\\nI love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue\\nFeel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs\\nSweet Mary Jane won’t you me sing another song\\n\\nNa na na na na Sweet Mary Jane\\nNa na na na na Sweet Mary Jane\\nNa na na na na Sweet Mary Jane\\nNa na na na na Sing another song\\n\\nMary Jane,\\nI’ve been hoping alone\\nMary Jane,\\nSince you came along\\nMary Jane,\\nI’m almost home\\nMary Jane,\\nSing another song\\n\\n‘Cause everyday that I’m breathing I think you are the one\\nI love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue\\nFeel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs\\nSweet Mary Jane won’t you me sing another song\\n\\n‘Cause everyday that I’m breathing, sweet Mary Jane\\nI love the sound of your sweet words, sweet Mary Jane\\nFeel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs\\nSweet Mary Jane won’t you sing me another song\\nI can taste salt water\\nAnd if I blink again\\nYou’ll be sinking in\\nSo we’ll learn to swim in the ocean\\nYou made to hold ya\\nAnd you think of him\\nAnd pretty soon you’ll be floating away\\nAnd I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of\\nAnchored down in my throat, love\\nAnd I’m captain of this sinking boat, now\\nWe just want all men to carry me home\\nThe salted tears won’t dry\\nI’ll wipe my shirtsleeves\\nUnder your eyes\\nThese hearts will be flooded tonight\\nI’ll wipe my shirtsleeves\\nUnder your eyes\\nYour eyes, your eyes, your eyes,your eyes\\n\\nI still taste salt water\\nOn my lips from your kiss bitterness\\nAnd I drown within the ocean you made\\nAnd I hate to love you, these cuffs cover in your make up\\nI’ll never trust you again\\nYou can just be a friend\\nAnd I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of\\nAnchored down in my throat, love\\nAnd I’m captain of this sinking boat, now\\nWe just want all men to carry me home\\nThe salted tears won’t dry\\nI’ll wipe my shirtsleeves\\nUnder your eyes\\nThese hearts will be flooded tonight\\nI’ll wipe my shirtsleeves\\nUnder your eyes\\nYour eyes, your lips, your mouth\\nYour thighs, your back, you drive me wild\\nTonight, the fact design\\nI’m on my way home\\nOn the way home\\nI lied, I tried to cry but I’m drowning in the ocean you made\\n\\nThe salted tears won’t dry\\nI’ll wipe my shirtsleeves\\nUnder your eyes\\nThese hearts will be flooded tonight\\nI’ll wipe my shirtsleeves\\nUnder your eyes\\nYour eyes, your eyes, you eyes\\nYou\\'re just a small bump unborn, in four months you\\'re brought to life,\\nYou might be left with my hair, but you\\'ll have your mother\\'s eyes,\\nI\\'ll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can, but for now your scan of my unmade plans,\\nA small bump in four months, you\\'re brought to life\\n\\nI\\'ll whisper quietly, and give you nothing but truth,\\nIf you\\'re not inside me, I\\'ll put my future in you\\n\\nYou are my one and only.\\nYou can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\\nOh, you are my one and only.\\nYou can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\\nAnd you\\'ll be alright.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re just a small bump unknown, you\\'ll grow into your skin.\\nWith a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin.\\nFinger nails the size of a half grain of rice,\\nAnd eyelids closed to be soon opened wide\\nA small bump, in four months you\\'ll open your eyes.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll hold you tightly, and give you nothing but truth,\\nIf you\\'re not inside me, I\\'ll put my future in you\\n\\nYou are my one and only.\\nYou can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\\nOh, you are my one and only.\\nYou can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\\nAnd you\\'ll be alright.\\n\\nYou can lie with me,\\nWith your tiny feet\\nWhen you\\'re half asleep,\\nI\\'ll leave you be.\\nRight in front of me\\nFor a couple weeks\\nSo I can keep you safe.\\n\\n\\'Cause you are my one and only.\\nYou can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\\nYou are my one and only.\\nYou can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\\nAnd you\\'ll be alright.\\n\\nYou were just a small bump unborn for four months then torn from life.\\nMaybe you were needed up there but we\\'re still unaware as why.\\nYou\\'re just a small bump unborn, in four months you\\'re brought to life,\\nYou might be left with my hair, but you\\'ll have your mother\\'s eyes,\\nI\\'ll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can, but for now your scan of my unmade plans,\\nA small bump in

don\\'t know wanna know you\\'ve been\\nI was your new best friend\\nDo you know I\\'ll treat you like them\\nI know\\n\\nYou\\'re under my skin\\nBurning in my bloodstream\\nThese cars were the way that you left me\\nI guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin\\nBurning in my bloodstream\\nThese cars were the way that you left me\\nI guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me\\nA tattoo to remind me\\nA tattoo to remind me\\n\\nApologies for the way I\\'ve been\\nI couldn\\'t wash you off my skin\\nNo i, I couldn\\'t live without you\\nTears at night could drive but I

remind me\\nA tattoo to remind me\\nA tattoo to remind me\\nWhen your legs don\\'t work like they used to before\\nAnd I can\\'t sweep you off of your feet\\nWill your mouth still remember the taste of my love?\\nWill your eyes still smile from your cheeks?\\n\\nAnd darling I will be loving you \\'til we\\'re 70\\nAnd baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23\\nAnd I\\'m thinking \\'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways\\nMaybe just the touch of a hand\\nWell, me I fall in love with you every single day\\nAnd I just wanna tell you I am\\nSo honey now\\nTake me into your loving arms\\nKiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\nPlace your head on my beating heart\\nI\\'m thinking out loud\\nThat maybe we found love right where we are\\n\\nWhen my hair\\'s all but gone and

never grow old, it\\'s evergreen\\nAnd baby your smile\\'s forever in my mind and memory\\nI\\'m thinking \\'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways\\nMaybe it\\'s all part of a plan\\nWell, I\\'ll just keep on making the same mistakes\\nHoping that you\\'ll understand\\nBut baby now\\n\\nTake me into your loving arms\\nKiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\nPlace your head on my beating heart\\nThinking out loud\\nThat maybe we found love right where we are\\n\\nSo baby now\\nTake me into your loving arms\\nKiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\nOh darling, place your head on my beating heart\\nI\\'m thinking out loud\\nThat maybe we found love right where we are\\nOh baby we found love right where we are\\n\\nAnd we found love right where we are\\nWhite lips, pale face\\nBreathing in snowflakes\\nBurnt lungs, sour taste\\nLight\\'s gone, day\\'s end\\nStruggling to pay rent\\nLong nights, strange men\\n\\nAnd they say\\nShe\\'s in the Class A Team\\nStuck in her daydream\\nBeen this way since 18\\nBut lately her face seems\\nSlowly sinking, wasting\\nCrumbling like pastries\\nAnd they scream\\nThe worst things in life come free to us\\nCos we\\'re just under the upperhand\\nAnd go mad for a couple of grams\\nAnd she don\\'t want to go outside tonight\\nAnd in a pipe she flies to the Motherland\\nOr sells love to another man\\nIt\\'s too cold outside\\nFor angels to fly\\nAngels to fly\\n\\nRipped gloves, raincoat\\nTried to swim and stay afloat\\nDry house, wet clothes\\nLoose change, bank notes\\nWeary-eyed, dry throat\\nCool girl, no phone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd they say\\nShe\\'s in the Class A Team\\nStuck in her daydream\\nBeen this way since 18\\nBut lately her face seems\\nSlowly sinking, wasting\\nCrumbling like pastries\\nAnd they scream\\nThe worst things in life come free to us\\nCos we\\'re just under the upperhand\\nAnd go mad for a couple of grams\\nAnd she don\\'t want to go outside tonight\\nAnd in a pipe she flies to the Motherland\\nOr sells love to another man\\nIt\\'s too cold outside\\nFor angels to fly\\nAngels to fly\\n\\nAnd they say\\nShe\\'s in the Class A Team\\nStuck in her daydream\\nBeen this way

angels to fly\\nTo fly\\nFor angels to die\\nI\\'m not a rapper\\nI\\'m a singer with a flow\\nI\\'ve got a habit of spitting\\nQuicker lyrics you know\\nYou found me ripping the writtens\\nOut of the pages they sit in\\nAnd never once I get bitten,\\nBecause plagiarism is hidden\\nWhich I would sit on the rhythm,\\nPrisoner with a vision\\n\\nSigned to a label, but didn\\'t listen to any criticism\\nThought you knew but you didn\\'t\\nSo perk your ears up and listen\\nStudio with a system\\nAnd you could say that I\\'m driven\\nAnd now it\\'s on to the next saga\\nWe drink the best lager\\nI never tried to win you\\nOver like your stepfather\\nI do my own thing now, and get respect after\\nAnd I\\'m avoiding the cane like it was Get Carter\\n\\nFor four years I never had a place to stay\\nBut it\\'s safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight\\nAt 16 years old I moved out of my home\\nI was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and\\nI choked\\nAnd we\\'ve been sleeping at the subway station, sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population\\nNot my imagination, I don\\'t want to relax\\nBut would it hurt your reputation,\\nIf I put it on wax?\\nI take it back now\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[chorus]\\nCome on and take it back love\\nCome on and take it back for us\\nDon\\'t you fade into the back love, oh\\n\\nTake it back with the rhythm and blues\\nAnd my back pack I\\'ll be singing the news,\\nTrying to act like Jack Black when I bring him to school\\nI\\'ll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop,\\nBringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes,\\nI give you the truth through the vocal booth,\\nStars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit,\\nThey try and take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot,\\nBut then again that\\'s what they\\'re supposed to do,\\nAnd I\\'m supposed to be calm,\\nI tattooed the lyrics onto my arm, whispering everything that happens is from now on,\\nI\\'ll be ready to start it again at the end of the song,\\nStill they claiming that I handled it wrong,\\nBut then I never had an enemy, except for NME,\\nBut I\\'ll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be,\\nWith only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees,\\nAre healthier than a dalmatian with pedigree\\nSinging for the masses,\\nRubber dinghy rapids,\\nKeep this rapping a habit\\nAnd keep on fashioning magic,\\nI\\'m battling with respect,\\nI don\\'t know if I\\'ll have it,\\nThis songs from the heart,\\nCovering the planet,\\nI\\'ll take it back now\\n\\n[chorus]\\nCome on and take it back love\\nCome on and take it back for us\\nDon\\'t you fade into the back love, oh\\n\\nTake it back now\\nNow, I don\\'t ever want to be perfect,\\nCause I\\'m a singer that you\\nNever want to see shirtless\\nI accept the fact that someone\\'s got to win the worst-dressed,\\nTaking my first steps into the scene,\\nGiving me focus\\nPutting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton\\nConsidering a name change,\\nThinking it was hopeless\\nRhyming over recordings\\nAvoiding tradition\\nCause every day some lyrics\\nAnd a melody can be written\\nNow absence can make your heart ache\\nBut drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly,\\nI need to let my liver be\\nAnd I say it again,\\nLiving life on the edge,\\nWith a closed hand full of friends\\nIs good advice from a man\\nWho took his life on the road with me\\nAnd I hope to see him blowing up globally\\nCause that\\'s how it\\'s supposed to be\\nI\\'m screaming out vocally\\nMight seem totally impossible\\nAchieving life\\'s dreams\\nBut, but I just write schemes\\nI\\'m never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans\\nMadison Square Garden is where I might be\\nBut more likely,\\nYou\\'ll find me in the back\\nRoom of a dive bar with my mates\\nHaving a pint with McDaid\\nDiscussing records we made\\nAnd every single second knowing\\nThat we\\'ll never betray\\nThe way we were raised\\nRemembering our background\\nSat down\\nThat\\'s how we plan it out;\\nIt\\'s time to take it back now\\n\\n[chorus]\\nCome on and take it back love\\nCome on and take it back for us\\nDon\\'t you fade into the back love, oh\\n\\nCome on and take it back love\\nCome on and take it back for us\\nDon\\'t you fade into the back love, oh\\n\\nMy dreams keep me awake at night\\nWritten in rhymes, and lies, deliver the hype\\nAm I just living the lie\\nWith this you must know that the number\\'s just sold woah\\nWill keep me going through the tough times, dream with me\\nWe forget 90 per cent of it when we wake\\nBut the other 10 per cent it never fades\\nDreaming dreams, day to day goals\\nStay awake loads, try to make the cut like the\\nPaper or razor blade, oh, never give up\\nAnd just remember just to hold out more\\nA couple years ago\\nI couldn\\'t just control that thought\\nYou\\'d find me buskin\\' on the street\\nWhen it was cold outdoors\\nAnd now I\\'m sweating on the stage\\nOf a sold out tour\\nWriting love songs for the sake of it\\nNever to make a hit\\nYou can\\'t fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick\\nI\\'m not a rapper I\\'m a singer, I just take the piss and\\nMost of these other guys are kids that posties\\nLittle sister has to babysit, that\\'s just a way it is\\nDreams are your own, just set your goals\\nAnd have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path\\nYou\\'ll never make it as a follower, you\\'ll never know\\nWhere you will go or where you will be tomorrow\\nYou look so wonderful in your dress\\nI love your hair like that\\nThe way it falls on the side of your neck\\nDown your shoulders and back\\n\\nWe are surrounded by all of these lights\\nAnd people who talk too much\\nYou\\'ve got that kind of look in your eyes\\nAs if no one knows anything but us\\n\\nAnd should this be the last thing I see\\nI want you to know it\\'s enough for me\\nCause all that you are is all that I\\'ll ever need\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m so in love, so in love\\nSo in love, so in love\\n\\nYou look so beautiful in this light\\nYour silhouette over me\\nThe way it brings out the blue in your eyes\\nIs the Tenerife sea\\n\\nAnd all of the voices surrounding us here\\nThey just fade out when you take a breath\\nJust say the word and I will disappear\\nInto the wilderness\\n\\nAnd should this be the last thing I see\\nI want you to know it\\'s

could get bad\\nBut when I broke the industry\\nThat\\'s when I broke your heart\\nI was supposed to chart and celebrate\\nBut good things are over fast\\nI know it\\'s hard to deal with and see this\\nI tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features\\nThen I turn the music off\\nAnd all I\\'m left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus\\nI never really want to believe

hook\\nCause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could\\nThe irony is if my career and music didn\\'t exist\\nIn 6 years, yeah, you\\'d probably be my wife with a kid\\nI\\'m frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink\\nAnd lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it\\'s\\nJust hiding my misguiding thoughts that I\\'m trying to kill\\nAnd I\\'d be writing my will before I\\'m 27, I\\'ll die from a thrill\\nGo down in history as just a wasted talent\\nCan I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing?\\nIt\\'s only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of

loving arms\n","Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars\n","Place your head on my beating heart\n","I'm thinking out loud\n","That maybe we found love right where we are\n","When my hair's all but

your head on my beating heart\n","Thinking out loud\n","That maybe we found love right where we are\n","So baby now\n","Take me into your loving arms\n","Kiss me under the light of a thousand

see, the way our horizons meet\n","And all of the lights will lead, into the night with me\n","And I know these scars will bleed\n","But both of our hearts believe\n","All of these stars will guide us home\n","I can hear your heart on the radio beat\n","They're playing \"Chasing Cars\" and I thought of us\n","Back to the time you were laying next to me\n","I looked across and fell in love\n","So I took your hand back through London's streets and knew\n","Everything led back to you\n","So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?\n","Hear the song our heart is beating to?\n","\n","So open your eyes

me back to when I\n","Found my heart and broke it here\n","Made friends and lost them through the years\n","And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown\n","But I can't wait to go home\n","I'm on my way\n","Driving at 90 down those country lanes\n","Singing to \"Tiny Dancer\"\n","And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real\n","We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\n","\n","Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes\n","Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends\n","Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right\n","But I was younger then, take me back to when\n","We found weekend jobs, when we got paid\n","We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight\n","Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown\n","But I can't wait to go home\n","I'm on my way\n","Driving at 90 down those country lanes\n","Singing to \"Tiny Dancer\"\n","And I miss the way you

by the coast\n","One had two kids but lives alone\n","One's brother overdosed\n","One's already on his second wife\n","One's just barely getting by\n","But these people raised me\n","And I can't wait to go home\n","And I'm on my way, I still remember\n","These old country lanes\n","When we did not know the answers\n","And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real\n","We watched the sunset over

she was only looking for a lover to burn\n","But I gave her my time for two or three nights\n","Then I put it on pause until the moment was right\n","I went away for months until our paths crossed again\n","She told me I was never looking for a friend\n","Maybe you could swing by my room around 10\n","Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin\n","We’ll be in between the sheets until the late

day\n","Those shows have never been what it’s about\n","But maybe we’ll go together and just figure it out\n","I’d rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch\n","But we should get on a plane\n","Or we’ll be missing it now\n","Wish I’d have written it down\n","The way that things played out\n","When she was kissing him\n","How?

take him to bed that’s all\n","And I never saw him as a threat\n","Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course\n","It’s not like we were both on tour\n","We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor\n","And I wasn’t looking for a promise or commitment\n","But it was never just fun and I thought you were different\n","This is not the way you realize what you wanted\n","It’s a bit too

getting by\n","But these people raised me\n","And I can't wait to go home\n","And I'm on my way, I still remember\n","These old country lanes\n","When we did not know the answers\n","And I miss the

too\n","In the summer, as the lilacs blew\n","Blood flows deeper than a river\n","Every moment that I spend with you\n","We were sat upon our best friend's roof\n","I had both of my arms around

loving arms\n","Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars\n","Place your head on my beating heart\n","I'm thinking out loud\n","That maybe we found love right where we are\n","When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades\n","And the crowds don't remember my name\n","When my hands don't play the strings the same way\n","I know you will still love me the same\n","'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen\n","And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory\n","I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways\n","Maybe it's all part of a plan\n","Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes\n","Hoping that you'll understand\n","But baby now\n","Take me into your loving arms\n","Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars\n","Place your head on my beating heart\n","Thinking out loud\n","That maybe we found love right where we are\n","So baby now\n","Take me into your loving arms\n","Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars\n","Oh darling,

the way our horizons meet\n","And all of the lights will lead, into the night with me\n","And I know these scars will bleed\n","But both of our hearts believe\n","All of these stars will guide us home\n","I can hear your heart on the radio beat\n","They're playing \"Chasing Cars\" and I thought of us\n","Back to the time you were laying next to me\n","I looked across and fell in love\n","So I took your hand back through London's streets and knew\n","Everything led back to you\n","So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?\n","Hear the song our heart is beating to?\n","So open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet\n","And all of the lights will lead into the night with me\n","And I know these scars will bleed\n","But both of our hearts believe\n","All of these stars will guide us

was six years old I broke my leg\n","I was running from my brother and his friends\n","And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down\n","I was younger then, take me back to when I\n","Found my heart and broke it here\n","Made friends and lost them through the years\n","And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown\n","But I can't wait to go home\n","I'm on my way\n","Driving at 90 down those country lanes\n","Singing to \"Tiny Dancer\"\n","And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real\n","We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\n","Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes\n","Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends\n","Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right\n","But I was younger then, take me back to when\n","We found weekend jobs, when we got paid\n","We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight\n","Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown\n","But I can't wait to go home\n","I'm on my way\n","Driving at 90 down those country lanes\n","Singing to \"Tiny Dancer\"\n","And I miss the way you make me

coast\n","One had two kids but lives alone\n","One's brother overdosed\n","One's already on his second wife\n","One's just barely getting by\n","But these people raised me\n","And I can't wait to go home\n","And I'm on my way, I still remember\n","These old country lanes\n","When we did not know the answers\n","And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real\n","We watched the sunset over the

me on the shelf, my farewell\n","So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself\n","And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself\n","And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself\n","I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill\n","I threw the day old tea from the cup\n","Packed up the photo album Matthew had made\n","Memories of a life that's been loved\n","Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals\n","Poured the old ginger been down the sink\n","Dad always told me, \"Don't you cry when you're down\"\n","But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink\n","Oh I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know\n","A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved\n","So I'll sing Hallelujah\n","You were an angel in the shape of my mum\n","When I fell down you'd be there holding me up\n","Spread your wings as you go\n","And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah\n","You're home\n","I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up\n","Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case\n","John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek\n","And wiped a tear from the side of my face\n","I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know\n","A life with love is a life that's been lived\n","So I'll sing Hallelujah\n","You were an angel in the shape of my mum\n","When I fell down you'd be there holding me up\n","Spread your wings as you go\n","And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah\n","You're home\n","Hallelujah\n","You were an angel in the shape of my mum\n","You got to see the person I have become\n","Spread your wings and I'll know that\n","When God took you back he said Hallelujah\n","You're home...\n","The club isn't the best place to find a lover\n","So the bar is where I go\n","Me and my friends at the table doing shots\n","Drinking faster and then we talk slow\n","Come over and start up a conversation with just me\n","And trust me I'll give it a chance now\n","Take my hand,

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks? And darling I will be loving you \\'til we\\'re 70 And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23 And I\\'m thinking \\'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways Maybe just the touch of a hand Well, me I fall in love with you every single day And I just wanna tell you I am So honey now Take me into your loving arms Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars Place your head on my beating heart I\\'m thinking out loud That maybe we found love right where we are When my hair\\'s all but gone and my memory fades And the crowds don\\'t remember my name When my hands don\\'t play the strings the same way I know you will still love me the same \\'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it\\'s evergreen And baby your smile\\'s forever in my mind and memory I\\'m thinking \\'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways Maybe it\\'s all part of a plan Well, I\\'ll just keep on making the same mistakes Hoping that you\\'ll understand But baby now Take me into your loving arms Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars Place your head on my beating heart Thinking out loud That maybe we found love right where we are So baby now Take me into your loving arms Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart I\\'m thinking out loud That maybe we found love right where we are Oh baby we found love right where we are And we found love right where we are It\\'s just another night, and I\\'m staring at the moon I saw a shooting star and thought of you I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew If you were here, I\\'d sing to you You\\'re on the other side, as this skyline splits in two Miles away from seeing you But I can see the stars from America I wonder do you see them too? So open your eyes and see, the way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead, into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home I can hear your heart on the radio beat They\\'re playing \"Chasing Cars\" and I thought of us Back to the time you were laying next to me I looked across and fell in love So I took your hand back through London\\'s streets and knew Everything led back to you So can you see the stars over Amsterdam? Hear the song our heart is beating to? So open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home And all And all And all I can see the stars from America Things were all good yesterday And then the devil took your memory And if you fell to your death today I hope that heaven is your resting place I heard the doctors put your chest in pain But then that could have been the medicine And now you’re lying in the bed again Either way I’ll cry with the rest of them. And my father told me, “Son, It’s not his fault he doesn’t know your face, And you’re not the only one. Although my grandma used to say, that he used to sing Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night And we\\'ll lie inside, a little while he wrote I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up And we’re wrapped in light, in life, in love. Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut For they’re designed to be together oh With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one And we’re set alight, we’re afire love, love, love oh. Things were all good yesterday Then the devil took your breath away And now we’re left here in the pain Black suit, black tie standin\\' in the rain And now my family is one again Stapled together with the strangers and a friend.

For how long I love my lover, now, now? For how long long I love my lover, now, now? x3 (and I feel love) For how long long I love my lover? (feel it all over now now and I feel love) x5 For how long I love my lover, now, now? For how long long I love my lover? I was twenty-four years old when I met the woman I would call my own Twenty two grand kids now growing old in that house that your brother bought ya Oh the summer day when I proposed, I made that wedding ring from [?] gold And I asked her father, but her daddy said, \"No, you won\\'t marry my daughter\" She and I went on the run Don\\'t care about religion I\\'m gonna marry the woman I love Down by the wexford border She was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran She took my name and then we were one Down by the wexford border Will I met her at [Guy\\'s?] in the second world war She was working on a soldier\\'s ward Never had I seen such beauty before The second that I saw her Nancy was my yellow rose And we got married wearing borrowed clothes We got eight children now growing old Five sons and three daughters She and I went on the run Don\\'t care about religion I\\'m gonna marry the woman I love Down by the wexford border She was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran She took my name and then we were one Down by the wexford border From her snow white in her [?] and jet black hair Over sixty years I\\'ve been loving her Now we\\'re sat by the fire in our old armchairs You know Nancy I adore ya From a farm boy born near Belfast town I never worried about the king and crown \\'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground That\\'s the difference, I \\xa0assure ya She and I went on the run Don\\'t care about religion I\\'m gonna marry the woman I love Down by the wexford border She was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran She took my name and then we were one Down by the wexford border I met you when I was a teen But then you were one as well And I could play the guitar Just like ringing a bell Sometimes I wonder And any other summer could you have been my part time lover To me listening to Stevie Wonder Under the covers where we used to lay And Re: Stacks is what the speakers play I’ll be on tour almost every day When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed Getting high as two kites, we needed no breathe We used each others edge just for the people to see And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep We go anywhere, our minds would take us And also you are beautiful without your make-up And you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause We can all be loved the way God made us And time’s the only reason that we could break up Cause you would always tell me I\\'m away too much Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane Or make a mistake, say it again Oh Nina You should go Nina ‘Cause I ain’t ever coming home Nina, oh, won’t you leave me now And I’ve been living on the road Nina But then again you should know Nina Cause that’s you and me both Nina, oh, won’t you leave me now Now And every weekend in the winter You’d be wearing my hoodie With draw strings pulled tight To keep your face from the cold Taking day trips to the local Where we be on the road Cause every day when I was away We\\'d only speak on the phone Watching Blue Planet Creating new habits Acting as if we were two rabbits And then you\\'d vanish Back to the borrow with all the Celtics I disappear You call me selfish, I understand But I can’t help it I put my job over everything Except my family and friends But you’ll be in between forever So I guess we’ll have to take a step back Overlook the situation Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications And I’m not saying we should be taking a break Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late So we kinda need to deal with the pain Or wait to get on the plane But in the day we’ll have to say it again Oh Nina You should go Nina ‘Cause I ain’t ever coming home Nina, oh, won’t you leave me now And I’ve been living on the road Nina But then again you should know Nina Cause that’s you and me both Nina, oh, won’t you leave me now Now Love will come and love will go But you can make it on your own Sing that song, go, oh won’t you leave me now People grow, and fall apart But you can mend your broken heart Take it back, oh oh won’t you leave me now Oh Nina You should go Nina ‘Cause I ain’t ever coming home Nina, oh, won’t you leave me now And I’ve been living on the road Nina But then again you should know Nina Cause that’s you and me both Nina, oh, won’t you leave me now Now No, no, no, no, no I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans Goes to the gym at least six times a week Wears both shoes with no socks on his feet And I hear he\\'s on a new diet at watches what he eats He\\'s got his eyebrows plucked and his asshole bleached Owns every single Ministry CD Tribal tattoos and he don\\'t know what it means But I heard he makes you happy, so that\\'s fine by me But still, I\\'m just keepin\\' it real Still lookin\\' at your Instagram and I\\'ll be creepin\\' a lil\\' I\\'ll be tryin\\' not to double tap, from way back \\'Cause I know that\\'s where the trouble\\'s at Let me remind you of the days when You used to hold my hand And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans I guess if you were Louis Lane, I wasn\\'t Superman Just a young boy tryin\\' to be loved So let me give it to ya I don\\'t wanna know about your new man \\'Cause if it was meant to me You wouldn\\'t be callin\\' me up tryin\\' to \\'Cause I\\'m positive that he don\\'t wanna know about me I don\\'t wanna know about your new man We\\'ll get there eventually I know you\\'re missin\\' all this kind of love But I\\'m positive that he don\\'t wanna know about me Your new man rents a house in the \\'burb And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I\\'m kinda jealous He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign Says, \"Cheya!\", boy never light up the room But enough about

Sheeran] Give me your old school love right now You know that only you and me alone... [Hook x2: Ed Sheeran] As long as I\\'m here As long as you love me Give me that old school love right now [Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco] Give me that late 80s early 90s old school Feeling like my second album, so cool Chiraq summer looking so cruel Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules Went to speak but was like never mind Let my mind just sneak back to a better time When I was his age and if he\\'s ever mine Thinking he would only think back to this and never find Better times to think back to when it comes And he\\'s older in the presence of somebody young Telling him the same things that he told me And he reacts the same way as that OG But it\\'s old school, it\\'s like \\'03 And this old man is my old me Takes a long time to happen so fast To realize that your future is somebody else\\'s past Wassup As long as I\\'m here As long as you love me Give me that old school love right now As long as I\\'m here As long as you love me Give me that old school love right now [Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco] Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good Top down, can\\'t be a classic if it\\'s no wood If you don\\'t know what, then you new school Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews Melli Mel\\'s, Ice-T\\'s, and the 2 Cools Add a Moe Dee and a Double L Had to walk cause it\\'s hard to run in those unbuckled shells One microphone and a couple 12s Six drum sounds and a couple bells Is all you had to make a couple rails And that\\'s a trap, and if you want it (eeeeeeeh) You have to make it like that Now what\\'s one turtle to a couple snails? Takes a long time to happen so fast And realize your future is somebody else\\'s past Wassup. [Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco] Chiraq summer looking so cruel How can I reel-to-reel when there\\'s Pro Tool? I can\\'t dig it at all because there\\'s no tube Fire when you speak but ain\\'t no warmth in your vocals Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind If it\\'s better with time then think in line That you\\'re going to be your nicest \\'round your midlife crisis If you\\'re life like Christ live your midlife like it\\'s... Christ-like Now I ain\\'t psychic I know it\\'s all a cycle and everybody bike it And France is enormous you\\'re Lance with endorsements But you might need a hand to enhance your performance Consider this a kilogram of encouragement Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement And when you get it through in a manner so cool Remember to give a little nod to the old school Wassup... [Bridge: Ed Sheeran] Give me your old school love right now I\\'m leaving it all up to you darling, giving you everything you want And give me that old school love right now You know that only you and me alone...

Well dad just don’t expect me back this evening Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this It’s been a long day Thumb on side of the roadway But I love him from the skin to my bones But I don’t wanna live in his home There’s nothing to say \\'cause he knows I’ll just runaway and be on my own. I’ve never seen my dad cry Cold as stone in the kitchen light I tell you it\\'s about time But I was raised to keep quiet. And this is what I’m gonna do Gonna runaway, gonna make that move Gonna grab clothes, and when it’s morning, go How long you leaving? Well dad just don’t expect me back this evening Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this It’s been a long day Thumb on side of the roadway But I love him from the skin to my bones But I don’t wanna live in his home. There’s nothing to say \\'cause he knows I’ll just runaway and be on my own. Back pack, and a flat cap, turned to the back As I packed my clothes up My dad wasn’t down with that plan to attack intends to show love. I don’t wanna live this way Gonna take my things and go If things change in a matter of days Could be persuaded to hold up And mama was the same None of us are saints And I guess that God knows that I don’t wanna runaway And one of these days I might just show that Put my home in a suitcase Tie both shoelaces, and hope that Things change, but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder But I love him from the skin to my bones But I don’t wanna live in his home There’s nothing to say \\'cause he knows I’ll just runaway and be on my own.

Cafe clouds and red lights When I gotcha in mind You slowed down time Oh baby I was out of my mind Sing a song cover and hold me tight I drill you deep into my chest That’s where it feels the best You can remove all the scars Stop them from breaking my heart Been on a hurting spree That brought out the worst in me ‘cause I don’t want to be alone ‘cause everyday that I’m breathing I think you are the one I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs Sweet Mary Jane won’t you sing another song Café clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky Oh baby what a beautiful sight But we’re only satellites Oh di ba di ba oh la lights Oh baby I am so damn high Have you seen my eyes With the beat beat of my heart You take me back to the start Where everything began Holding you inside my hands Between my fingers and thumb I seal you in with my tongue, ‘Cause I don’t want to be alone ‘Cause everyday that I’m breathing I think you are the one I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs Sweet Mary Jane won’t you me sing another song Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane Na na na na na Sing another song Mary Jane, I’ve been hoping alone Mary Jane, Since you came along Mary Jane, I’m almost home Mary Jane, Sing another song ‘Cause everyday that I’m breathing I think you are the one I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs Sweet Mary Jane won’t you me sing another song ‘Cause everyday that I’m breathing, sweet Mary Jane I love the sound of your sweet words, sweet Mary Jane Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs Sweet Mary Jane won’t you sing me another song I can taste salt water And if I blink again You’ll be sinking in So we’ll learn to swim in the ocean You made to hold ya And you think of him And pretty soon you’ll be floating away And I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of Anchored down in my throat, love And I’m captain of this sinking boat, now We just want all men to carry me home The salted tears won’t dry I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves Under your eyes These hearts will be flooded tonight I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves Under your eyes Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes,your eyes I still taste salt water On my lips from your kiss bitterness And I drown within the ocean you made And I hate to love you, these cuffs cover in your make up I’ll never trust you again You can just be a friend And I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of Anchored down in my throat, love And I’m captain of this sinking boat, now We just want all men to carry me home The salted tears won’t dry I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves Under your eyes These hearts will be flooded tonight I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves Under your eyes Your eyes, your lips, your mouth Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild Tonight, the fact design I’m on my way home On the way home I lied, I tried to cry but I’m drowning in the ocean you made The salted tears won’t dry I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves Under your eyes These hearts will be

And darling I will be loving you \\'til we\\'re 70 And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23 And I\\'m thinking \\'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways Maybe just the touch of a hand Well, me I fall in love with you every single day And I just wanna tell you I am So honey now Take me into your loving arms Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars Place your head on my beating heart I\\'m thinking out loud That maybe we found love right where we are When my hair\\'s all but gone and my memory fades And the crowds don\\'t remember my name When my hands don\\'t play the strings the same way I know you will still love me the same \\'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it\\'s evergreen And baby your smile\\'s forever in my mind and memory I\\'m thinking \\'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways Maybe it\\'s all part of a plan Well, I\\'ll just keep on making the same mistakes Hoping that you\\'ll understand But baby now Take me into your loving arms Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars Place your head on my beating heart Thinking out loud That maybe we found love right where we are So baby now Take me into your loving arms Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart I\\'m thinking out loud That maybe we found love right where we are Oh baby we found love right where we are And we found love right where we are White lips, pale face Breathing in snowflakes Burnt lungs, sour taste Light\\'s gone, day\\'s end Struggling to pay rent Long nights, strange men And they say She\\'s in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since 18 But lately her face seems Slowly sinking, wasting Crumbling like pastries And they scream The worst things in life come free to us Cos we\\'re just under the upperhand And go mad for a couple of grams And she don\\'t want to go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland Or sells love to another man It\\'s too cold outside For angels to fly Angels to fly Ripped gloves, raincoat Tried to swim and stay afloat Dry house, wet clothes Loose change, bank notes Weary-eyed, dry throat Cool girl, no phone And they say She\\'s in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since 18 But lately her face seems Slowly sinking, wasting Crumbling like pastries And they scream The worst things in life come free to us Cos we\\'re just under the upperhand And go mad for a couple of grams And she don\\'t want to go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland Or sells love to another man It\\'s too cold outside For angels to fly Angels to fly And they say She\\'s in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since 18 But lately her face seems Slowly sinking, wasting Crumbling like pastries And they scream The worst things in life come free to us Cos we\\'re just under the upperhand And go mad for a couple of grams And she don\\'t want to go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland Or sells love to another man It\\'s too cold outside For angels to fly For angels to fly To fly For angels to die I\\'m not a rapper I\\'m a singer with a flow I\\'ve got a habit of spitting Quicker lyrics you know You found me ripping the writtens Out of the pages they sit in And never once I get bitten, Because plagiarism is hidden Which I would sit on the rhythm, Prisoner with a vision Signed to a label, but didn\\'t listen to any criticism Thought you knew but you didn\\'t So perk your ears up and listen Studio with a system And you could say that I\\'m driven And now it\\'s on to the next saga We drink the best lager I never tried to win you Over like your stepfather I do my own thing now, and get respect after And I\\'m avoiding the cane like it was Get Carter For four years I never had a place to stay But it\\'s safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight At 16 years old I moved out of my home I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked And we\\'ve been sleeping at the subway station, sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population Not my imagination, I don\\'t want to relax But would it hurt your reputation, If I put it on wax? I take it back now [chorus] Come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don\\'t you fade into the back love, oh Take it back with the rhythm and blues And my back pack I\\'ll be singing the news, Trying to act like Jack Black when I bring him to school I\\'ll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop, Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes, I give you the truth through the vocal booth, Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit, They try and take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot, But then again that\\'s what they\\'re supposed to do, And I\\'m supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm, whispering everything that happens is from now on, I\\'ll be ready to start it again at the end of the song, Still they claiming that I handled it wrong, But then I never had an enemy, except for NME, But I\\'ll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be, With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees, Are healthier than a dalmatian with pedigree Singing for the masses, Rubber dinghy rapids, Keep this rapping a habit And keep on fashioning magic, I\\'m battling with respect, I don\\'t know if I\\'ll have it, This songs from the heart, Covering the planet, I\\'ll take it back now [chorus] Come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don\\'t you fade into the back love, oh Take it back now Now, I don\\'t ever want to be perfect, Cause I\\'m a singer that you Never want to see shirtless I accept the fact that someone\\'s got to win the worst-dressed, Taking my first steps into the scene, Giving me focus Putting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton Considering a name change, Thinking it was hopeless Rhyming over recordings Avoiding tradition Cause every day some lyrics And a melody can be written Now absence can make your heart ache But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly, I need to let my liver be And I say it again, Living life on the edge, With a closed hand full of friends Is good advice from a man Who took his life on the road with me And I hope to see him blowing up globally Cause that\\'s how it\\'s supposed to be I\\'m screaming out vocally Might seem totally impossible Achieving life\\'s dreams But, but I just write schemes I\\'m never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be But more likely, You\\'ll find me in the back Room of a dive bar with my mates Having a pint with McDaid Discussing records we made And every single second knowing That we\\'ll never betray The way we were raised Remembering our background Sat down That\\'s how we plan it out; It\\'s time to take it back now [chorus] Come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don\\'t you fade into the back love, oh Come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don\\'t you fade into the back love, oh My dreams keep me awake at night Written in rhymes, and lies, deliver the hype Am I just living the lie With this you must know that the number\\'s just sold woah Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake But the other 10 per cent it never fades Dreaming dreams, day to day goals Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up And just remember just to hold out more A couple years ago I couldn\\'t just control that thought You\\'d find me buskin\\' on the street When it was cold outdoors And now I\\'m sweating on the stage Of a sold out tour Writing love songs for the sake of it Never to make a hit You can\\'t fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick I\\'m not a rapper I\\'m a singer, I just take the piss and Most of these other guys are kids that posties Little sister has to babysit, that\\'s just a way it is Dreams are your own, just set your goals And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path You\\'ll never make it as a follower, you\\'ll never know Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow You look so wonderful in your dress I love your hair like that The way it falls on the side of your neck Down your shoulders and back We are surrounded by all of these lights And people who talk too much You\\'ve got that kind of look in your eyes As if no one knows anything but us And should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it\\'s enough for me Cause all that you are is all that I\\'ll ever need I\\'m so in love, so in love So in love, so in love You look so beautiful in this light Your silhouette over me The way it brings out the blue in your eyes Is the Tenerife sea And all of the voices surrounding us here They just fade out when you take a breath Just say the word and I will disappear Into the wilderness And should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it\\'s enough for me Cause all that you are is all that I\\'ll ever need I\\'m so in love, so in love So in love, so in love Lumiere, darling Lumiere over me [x6] And should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it\\'s enough for me Cause all that you are is all that I\\'ll ever need I\\'m so in love, so in love So in love, love, love, love, So in love You look so wonderful in your dress I loved your hair like that And in the moment I knew you best Now I don\\'t wanna hate you Just wish you\\'d never gone for the man And waited two weeks at least Before you let him take you I stayed true I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school He\\'s waiting for the time to move I knew he had his eyes on you He\\'s not the right guy for you Don\\'t hate me cause I write the truth No I would never lie to you But it was never fine to lose you And what a way to find out It never came from my mouth You never changed your mind But you were just afraid to mind out But f- it, I won\\'t be changing the subject I love it I\\'ll make your little secret public it\\'s nothing I\\'m just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me Trapped and I\\'m lacking sleep Fact is you\\'re mad at me because I backtrack so casually You\\'re practically my family If we married then I\\'ll guess you\\'d have to be But tragically our love just lost the will to live But would I kill to give it one more shot I think not [Hook] I don\\'t love you baby I don\\'t need you baby I don\\'t want you no Anymore I don\\'t love you baby I don\\'t need you baby I don\\'t wanna love you no Anymore Recently I tend to zone out Up in my headphones to Holocene You promised your body but I\\'m away so much I stay more celibate than in a monastery I\\'m not cut out for life on the road Cause I didn\\'t know I\\'d miss you this much And at the time we\\'d just go, so sue me I guess I\\'m not the man that you need Ever since you went to uni I\\'ve been sofa surfing with a rucksack Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad But when I broke the industry That\\'s when I broke your heart I was supposed to chart and celebrate But good things are over fast I know it\\'s hard to deal with and see this I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features Then I turn the music off And all I\\'m left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus I never really want to believe this Got advice from my dad and he Told me that family is all I\\'ll ever have and need I guess I\\'m unaware of it Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with I don\\'t love you baby I don\\'t need you baby I don\\'t want you no Anymore I don\\'t love you baby I don\\'t need you baby I don\\'t wanna love you no Anymore And since you left, I\\'ve given up my days off It\\'s what I need to stay strong I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7 I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could The irony is if my career and music didn\\'t exist In 6 years, yeah, you\\'d probably be my wife with a kid I\\'m frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it\\'s Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I\\'m trying to kill And I\\'d be writing my will before I\\'m 27, I\\'ll die from a thrill Go down in history as just a wasted talent Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing? It\\'s only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me Eventually I\\'ll be fine I know that it was never meant to be Either way I guess I\\'m not prepared, but I\\'ll say this These things happen for a reason and you can\\'t change shit Take my apology, I\\'m sorry for the honesty But I had to get this off my chest I don\\'t love you baby I don\\'t need you baby I don\\'t want you no Anymore I don\\'t love you baby I don\\'t need you baby I don\\'t wanna love you no Anymore Ain\\'t got a soapbox I can stand upon But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song My daddy told me, \"Son, don\\'t you get involved in Politics, religions or other people\\'s quotes\" I\\'ll paint the picture, let me set the scene I know when I have children they will know what it means And I pass on these things my family\\'s given to me Just love and understanding, positivity We could change this whole world with a piano Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat And away we go I\\'m just a boy with a one-man show No university, no degree But lord knows everybody\\'s talking \\'bout exponential growth And the star monkey crashing in their portfolios While I\\'ll be sitting here with a song I wrote Sing, love could change the world in a moment But what do I know? Love can change the world in a moment But what do I know? Love can change the world in a moment The revolution\\'s coming, it\\'s a minute away I saw people marching in the streets today You know we are made up of love and hate But both of them are balanced on a razor blade I\\'ll paint the picture, let me set the scene I know, I\\'m all for people following their dreams Just re-remember life is more than fitten\\' in your jeans It\\'s love and understanding, positivity We could change this whole world with a piano Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat And away we go I\\'m just a boy with a one-man show No university, no degree But lord knows everybody\\'s talking \\'bout exponential growth And the star monkey crashing in their portfolios While I\\'ll be sitting here with a song I wrote Sing, love could change the world in a moment But what do I know? Love can change the world in a moment But what do I know? Love can change the world in a moment I\\'ll paint the picture, let me set the scene You know, the future\\'s in the hands of you and me So let\\'s all get together, we can alle be free Spread love and understanding, positivity We could change this whole world with a piano Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat And away we go I\\'m just a boy with a one-man show No university, no degree But lord knows everybody\\'s talking \\'bout exponential growth And the star monkey crashing in their portfolios While I\\'ll be sitting here with a song I wrote Sing, love could change the world in a moment But what do I know?
